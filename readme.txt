A test plugin for SonyMobile.com Dev Test to display all subpages of the page it placed in 

== Description ==
This is a plugin as part of the basic development task for the role of a front-end developer at SonyMobile.com. It will fetch and display all subpages titles, truncated after 20 characters and (if present) show a very small thumbnail-Â­version of the pages/posts 'featured image' next to the title of the page it is placed on. Each level should be able to be sorted by title in ascending and descending order. It should also be possible expand and collapsed each level. All this must be possible without reconnecting to the server after the page has been loaded.

== Installation ==
1. Upload \"somcandrewbarnard.php\" to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins\' menu in WordPress.
3. Place Wordpress shortcode '[subpage]' in your templates.
